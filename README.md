# Current Weather

## Project Description

**Current Weather** is a web application developed using the **React** library that allows users to get current weather information for a specified city. The application makes requests to external APIs to retrieve weather data and a corresponding city image.

## Features

- Search for weather by city name
- Retrieve information on temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other parameters
- Automatically load a background image of the city from **Pexels**
- Real-time weather updates using the **OpenWeatherMap** API

## Technologies Used

- **React** — library for building user interfaces
- **OpenWeatherMap API** — retrieving weather data
- **Pexels API** — loading city images
- **Fetch API** — performing HTTP requests
- **CSS** — styling the interface
